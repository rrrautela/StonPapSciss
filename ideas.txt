some ideas for future versions

1. random fact of the day, fetch from web and show it on top, if possible than a moving text
(right to left the starts again from the right somethign like that)

2. score, highscore

3. facts and history about stone paper scissors

4. time calculate to how many time since you are playing

5. add event listenerrs and images to press keys instead of clicking stone paper scissors
